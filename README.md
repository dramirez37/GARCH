# Volatility Cycle Analysis

This repository contains utilities for analyzing asset price volatility cycles.
The `volatility_cycle_analysis.py` script loads a CSV dataset, computes
realized volatility, detects dominant cycles and performs several
cross-asset analyses. Running the script now also produces basic
visualizations and summary tables that are useful when preparing results for
publication.

## Usage

```bash
python3 volatility_cycle_analysis.py
```

The script expects `mainz.zip` in the repo root. The archive should include a
CSV file for each ticker you wish to analyze. No extraction is necessaryâ€”the
script loads all of the files directly from the archive. Output CSV files and
figures are written to the working directory.
