# Volatility Cycle Analysis

This repository contains utilities for analyzing asset price volatility cycles.
The `volatility_cycle_analysis.py` script loads a CSV dataset, computes
realized volatility, detects dominant cycles and performs several
cross-asset analyses. Running the script now also produces basic
visualizations and summary tables that are useful when preparing results for
publication.

## Usage

```bash
python3 volatility_cycle_analysis.py
```

The script expects `mainz.zip` in the repo root. The archive should include a
CSV file for each ticker you wish to analyze. No extraction is necessary—the
script reads each file directly from the archive. These CSVs contain two
metadata rows followed by the header row at line 3, so the first line of price
data begins on row 4. The script automatically detects this layout.

Running the script writes summary tables and figures to the working directory,
including rolling correlation, cointegration and coherence heatmaps, PCA scree
plots and cluster assignments.
